# Tech News
## Written by the community

This news site is meant to take in articles about tech, games, projects, and anything else around the Science & Technology community on Twitch.

I am Astra, this site's curator, I will probably be the person you see the most often as an author but if you have an article you want to add in, head to the github repo and fork this repo.

After that copy the example.md file and make your news article. Once your done, submit a pull request and I will look it over.

Let's work together to make one of the finest community news sites!
